<h1>The Best Movies According to Lucca</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>1. Interstellar</h3>
<p>It's got a great soundtrack and the visuals are absolutely insane, there's no words to describe the movie itself...awesome sci-fi with a great plot and characters.</p>
<h3>2. Scarface</h3>
<p>Another great movie with an awesome plot about crime and drug trafficking with really good characters and story.</p>
<h3>3. Inception</h3>
<p>Like Interstellar, was also directed by Nolan and involves a confusing and intriguing plot. A really great movie which keeps you at the edge of your seat.</p>
