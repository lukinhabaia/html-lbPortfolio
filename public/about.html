<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Lucca, I'm a business student in Brazil. I first started
  having ideas to start my own business when I was around 18. After years
  of studying and mostly procrastinating, when I was in college, not working,
  21 years old, with no money, and I finally decided enough was enough.
</p>

<p>I had already talked about it with many of my friends in college, but it
  was always just talk. Then me and my current business partner decided we 
  were going to start our business and make it work. And we did, we started
  studying a lot, and this is when I learned about Web Development, for our
  business. We had everything set up, and then we started working and
  making our names, grew our business to the size it is now, and we still work
  hard and put 100% into it every single day, so we can help more and more
  businesses grow hugely each and every day.
</p>

<p>Now, I'm a Web Developer and I make sites and other designs for our 
  clients, we also do marketing for businesses, including copywriting,
  ads, paid traffic, among other services...And we're damn good at it.
</p>

<p>So be sure to contact me or our business "Lunavigo" so we can explain
  to you exactly how we can make your business grow exponentially and you
  can reach the top, especially among today's uncertainty.
